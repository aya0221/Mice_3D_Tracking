- Set Master Camera:
    - Select the camera you designated as the Master.
    - Navigate to its settings and look for an option related to synchronization or inter-camera sync mode.
    - Set this camera to Master mode (often represented as mode '1' in the settings).

- Set Slave Cameras:
    - For each of the Slave cameras, Navigate to its settings and look for an option related to synchronization or inter-camera sync mode.
    - Set these cameras to Slave mode (often mode '2').
    - Ensure that this setting is applied correctly to each Slave camera.

- Save your configuration if required.

- Check -> If their frames are aligned in time

[Materials Needed]
- Four Intel RealSense Cameras (1 Master, 3 Slaves)
- Connectors: ASSHSSH28K152
- Housing Parts: SHR-09V-S-B

    - Shielded Twisted Pair Cable
    - RS-485/RS-422 Transceivers (for longer distances)
    - RJ-45 Ethernet Patch Cables (for longer distances)


[Sync Cable Preparation]
- Cut the shielded twisted pair cable to required lengths.
- Attach connectors to both ends of each cable.
- Secure connectors with housing parts.


[Connecting Cameras]
- Designate one camera as Master.
- Connect each Slave camera to the Master using the prepared sync cables.
    -> (each Slave should only be connected to the Master.)
- Ensure connections align with pin 5 (SYNC) and pin 9 (Ground).
    -> pin 5 (SYNC) is connected to pin 5 on both the Master and Slave cameras.
    -> pin 9 (Ground) is connected to pin 9 on both cameras.


[How does it work]
- The Master camera is responsible for sending the synchronization signal, and the Slave cameras will synchronize their capture based on this signal.
